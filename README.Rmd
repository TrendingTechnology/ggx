## Overview

`ggplot2` is an R package for creating awesome graphics, based on [The Grammar of Graphics](https://amzn.to/2ef1eWp). It has changed my life as a scientist and developer.  However, I have terrible memory and with the complexity of `ggplot2`, I forget the same commands again and again. So I often end up searching Google for help and then I copy and paste the solution into my R script. Eventually, I wondered whether we couldn't save this extra step and just _talk_ to ggplot in natural language (similar to a Google search query). So, I wrote this package that let's you issue natural language commands that are translated into ggplot commands. This is how it looks:

```{r overview_usage}
ggplot(data=cars,aes(x=speed, y=dist))+geom_point()+
  gg_("rotate x-axis labels by 90 degrees")
```

## Disclaimer

I am pretty sure that this package violates fundamental principles of ggplot2. First and foremost, it would be much wiser to just study and learn the respective commands instead of relying on fuzzy and not well-defined natural language commands. Second, this package doesn't rely on fancy deep learning or other AI technology. It's a simple keyword matching algorithm. If someone fancies to replace this with a better approach, please do so. Contributions to this package are more then welcome!
